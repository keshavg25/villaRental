## 📄 Project Abstract

The **Villa Rental Website** is a full-stack web application developed as part of the **Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) final-year project**. The project aims to provide a digital platform for users to explore luxury villas, view detailed information, and submit booking or inquiry requests through an easy-to-use and responsive interface.

The system also includes an **admin panel** that allows administrators to manage villa listings, view user inquiries, and handle booking-related information efficiently. To enhance real-world usability, the project integrates an **email notification system**, enabling automated communication between users and administrators after inquiry or booking submission.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of frontend development, backend logic, database connectivity, and email handling, reflecting real-world web application development practices.
